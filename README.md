# Golf Mechanics

The purpose of this project is to learn about physics in golf for games in Unity using C#. However, the concepts could also be used in any engines or language.

The end goal of this project is to have
- A driving range scene which allows the user to see shot tajectories based on input parametres similar to [this website](https://flightscope.com/products/trajectory-optimizer/).
- A putting scene for putting lines on different slopes.
- [Bonus] If the first two things can even get done a single player match with a 18 hole course with score card

Hopefully this project wil help others gettings started in golf simulators or mini-putt games.
