# Golf Mechanics

The purpose of this project is to learn and gain an understanding of physics in golf for simlutaor games in Unity using C#. Though the concepts could be used in any engines or language. 

The end goal is to have a driving range scene which allows the user see shot tajectories in multiples of wind and weather types similar to [this](https://flightscope.com/products/trajectory-optimizer/) website.
and a putting scene. I want it to achieve realistic type physics but "close enough" is also good enough.

Hopefully this project wil help others gettings started in golf simulators or mini-putt games.
